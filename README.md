A modular dotfiles system built for **Arch Linux + Hyprland**, featuring unified theming, consistent UI/UX, and one-click light/dark toggle support. Managed cleanly using **[GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)**.

This rice was built **completely from scratch** by me — no borrowing from others' dotfiles. It might be rough around the edges, but I finally understand every part of my setup. Feels good.

## 🛠️ SwayNC Customization

I customized **SwayNC** by editing the `.blp` layout file **directly in the source code**, then rebuilding it with **Meson + Ninja**. This gave me full control over its layout and visuals — something not possible through CSS alone.

## 📦 Structure (Stow-compatible)

Each folder is a **Stow package** you can symlink into your `$HOME`.

## 🎨 Theme Toggle Script

Switch between **light** and **dark** mode across all supported apps:

```bash
~/.config/scripts/mode_toggle.py
```

✅ This affects:

- GTK 3/4 (via gsettings + config)
- Kitty, Waybar, Mako, Rofi
- VSCode (`settings.json`)
- Nemo (reloads if running)
- Sends themed notification

---

## 🌈 Themes & Styles

All theme variants are located in:

```
~/.config/NamiThemes/
```

Includes `light` and `dark` styles for:

- Kitty
- Waybar
- Rofi
- Mako
- SwayNC

These are auto-applied via the toggle script.

---

## 🖼 Wallpapers

Wallpapers used with `swww` live in:

```
~/.config/hypr/wall/
```

Hand-picked and themed to match the rice.
